Web Interface to the World Cup Sweepstake Stratis Smart Contract


this project template was built from scratch starting from this article 
http://www.talkingdotnet.com/implement-asp-net-core-spa-template-feature-in-angular6-app/

and building up needed features


I used the angular-cli to create components, you need to have angular-cli installed.

To install it open the console and type  
`npm install -g @angular/cli`


## Configuration ##
In the root folder, there is the `smartcontract.configuration.json` that store information about the smart contract address and the url of the local StratisFullNode that implements the SmartContractFeature (like the Stratis.StratisSmartContractsD daemon in the smartcontract branch of the official stratis repo)
